# data-library
*This is a simple GUI+database windows app coding with python, using tkinter and pymssql. As a example using unusual libs, it could be a guider for someone who wanna try them.*

Anyway,you should install Python3.x and MS SQL SERVER,which form a basic environment</br>
Use cmd coding</br>
```
pip install tkinter
```
However,by some unknown reason,pip install pymssql may cause a false,and,this is a website to download the package:</br>_https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#wordcloud_</br>As a example,download the version that fit Python3.6 and 64-bit pc,code
```
pip install pymssql‑2.1.3‑cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl
```
It May work.
